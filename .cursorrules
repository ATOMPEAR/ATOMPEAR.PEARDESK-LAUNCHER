- USE SASS PARTIALS TO MODULARIZE STYLESHEETS
- FOLLOW BEM METHODOLOGY WITH SASS NESTING CAPABILITIES
- USE SASS OPERATIONS AND COLOR FUNCTIONS

JAVASCRIPT

- IMPLEMENT PROPER ERROR HANDLING WITH TRY/CATCH BLOCKS
- USE ASYNC/AWAIT FOR ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS
- FOLLOW CONSISTENT NAMING CONVENTIONS (CAMELCASE FOR VARIABLES/FUNCTIONS)
- KEEP FUNCTIONS SMALL AND FOCUSED (SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY)
- USE MEANINGFUL VARIABLE AND FUNCTION NAMES
- COMMENT COMPLEX LOGIC AND DOCUMENT PUBLIC APIS
- USE STRICT MODE ('USE STRICT')

ELECTRON
- USE IPC COMMUNICATION FOR SECURE MAIN-RENDERER PROCESS INTERACTION
- IMPLEMENT PROPER SECURITY MEASURES INCLUDING CSP HEADERS
- HANDLE WINDOW STATE MANAGEMENT (MINIMIZE, MAXIMIZE, CLOSE)
- USE PRELOAD SCRIPTS TO SAFELY EXPOSE NODE APIs
- PROPERLY MANAGE APPLICATION LIFECYCLE EVENTS
- IMPLEMENT PROPER ERROR HANDLING FOR NATIVE OPERATIONS

RESPONSIVE DESIGN
- USE MEDIA QUERIES TO CREATE RESPONSIVE LAYOUTS.
- USE MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH FOR MEDIA QUERIES.
- ENSURE TOUCH TARGETS ARE LARGE ENOUGH FOR TOUCH DEVICES.
- USE RESPONSIVE IMAGES WITH SRCSET AND SIZES ATTRIBUTES.
- USE VIEWPORT META TAG FOR RESPONSIVE SCALING.

ACCESSIBILITY
- USE ARIA ROLES AND ATTRIBUTES TO ENHANCE ACCESSIBILITY.
- ENSURE SUFFICIENT COLOR CONTRAST FOR TEXT.
- PROVIDE KEYBOARD NAVIGATION FOR INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS.
- USE FOCUS STYLES TO INDICATE FOCUS STATE.
- USE LANDMARKS (E.G., <NAV>, <MAIN>, <ASIDE>) FOR SCREEN READERS.

- USE CONSISTENT NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR CLASSES AND IDS.
- DOCUMENT RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS AND DESIGN DECISIONS.
